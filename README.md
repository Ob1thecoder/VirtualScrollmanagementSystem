The ```django.pid``` file to track local machine process which run the Python HCI.


The database for this small scale project is db.sqlite3

<h3>Technology requirement</h3>

* Springboot : https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/installing.html

 * make tools :

   ** (for Linux)
```sudo apt-get -y install make```

   **  (for Windows)
``` choco install make ```

Install require python packages with <code>pip install requirement.txt</code>


To test run the codebase, while at the root github directory use ```make run-all``` 

To stop the program, go to the terminal,  ```make clean```
```
